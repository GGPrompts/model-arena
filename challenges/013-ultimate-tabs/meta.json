  "prompt": "Build the ultimate over-engineered tabs/panels dashboard in React (single HTML file with Babel standalone or a small bundled app).\n\nLAYOUT:\n- Tabs positioned around ALL sides of the screen (top, bottom, left, right)\n- Each side can have multiple icon tabs\n- Clicking a tab opens a sidebar/panel that slides in from that direction\n- Multiple panels can be open simultaneously\n- Panels can be resized by dragging edges\n- Panels can be pinned/unpinned (pinned stays open, unpinned closes when clicking away)\n\nTAB DESIGN:\n- Glass morphism effect (frosted glass, blur, transparency)\n- Beautiful icons (use a library like Lucide, Heroicons, or inline SVGs)\n- Subtle glow/highlight on hover\n- Smooth color transitions\n- Active tab indicator (glow, underline, or scale effect)\n- Tab groups with visual separators\n\nPANEL DESIGN:\n- Glass morphism matching the tabs\n- Smooth slide-in animations (spring physics if possible)\n- Header with title, pin button, close button\n- Content area with subtle scroll styling\n- Shadow/depth effect to show layering\n- Backdrop blur effect on the main content behind\n\nINTERACTIONS:\n- Keyboard shortcuts (1-9 for quick tab access, Escape to close all)\n- Drag tabs to reorder them\n- Double-click tab to maximize that panel\n- Right-click context menu on tabs (close, close others, settings)\n- Smooth 60fps animations throughout\n\nTHEME:\n- Dark mode with vibrant accent colors\n- Gradient backgrounds on panels\n- Consistent border radius and spacing\n- Make it look like a premium productivity app\n\nCONTENT:\n- Populate panels with placeholder content (settings panel, file browser, terminal, chat, notifications, etc.)\n- At least 3-4 tabs per side (12+ total tabs)\n- Show off the system with realistic-looking fake content\n\nMake it absurdly polished - the kind of UI that makes developers say \"okay that's too nice\".",
